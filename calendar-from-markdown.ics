DESCRIPTION:When a start time is specified\, but no end time\, events shoul
	d take on a default duration. One hour seems reasonable\, it's one unit or
	 whatever. Maybe default duration is configurable through an input option 
	when running the script.

DESCRIPTION:Note that I like writing times in 24-hour format. 12 hour vs 24
	 hour is probably worth making a configurable option at some point too... 
	but for now\, I think I'll stick with 24 hour.

DESCRIPTION:Note that the headings will be ignored completely. All the comp
	uter needs to look for is list items that start with `YYYY-MM-DD`. Heading
	s and other decoration are for human use\, our script can ignore them.
